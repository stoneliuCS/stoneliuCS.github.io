  In my opinion, teaching and leadership go hand in hand. During school I have been a TA a total of 3 times, a TL for ◊link["https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&opi=89978449&url=https://generatenu.com/&ved=2ahUKEwj4_unMsu-OAxUykokEHX7PMs0QFnoECBwQAQ&usg=AOvVaw1XXk3_2esPdzyDgbnaJCKV"]{Generate} twice and as of Aug 3rd 2025, serving as Chief of software.

  My first time TAing was an utter disaster, I TAed for a class where the core curriculum differed drastically from what I learned when I took the class. (I'm very sorry if I was your TA during that time). The more you learn the more you know that you don't know. But one of the core things I truly believe in is the idea that we are all leaders in one way or another.

  The golden rule in life is to appreciate the beautiful fact that you can learn something from everyone, and you can always teach something to anyone. So no matter where you go, you are shaped by the experiences of the people you meet.

Cheers to all the great leaders out there, thanks for making the world a better place.
