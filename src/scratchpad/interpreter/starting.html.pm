◊p{
  From my understanding a compiler is just a ◊em{very, very, very} sophisticated function.

  In essence it takes source code, and translates that into a ◊em{semantically} equivalent form in the target language.
}

◊code-block["racket"]{
  ;; The signature of a example compiler function in ISL.
  compiler: String -> String
  (define (compiler source)
    ...
  )
}

◊p{
  For now, lets try to translate this program written in an imaginary programming language called ◊em{StoneScript} (Creative am I right?)

  In my language, I prefer the arrow syntax to better communicate assignment statements.
}

◊code-block[""]{
  var x <- 2;
  var y <- 2;
  var z <- x + y;
}
